# Smart-Obstacle-Detection-for-blind
This project aims to develop an AI-powered navigation system that enhances mobility. Using a camera and a pretrained YOLOv5 model, the system detects obstacles, estimates distances, and provides real-time voice feedback. The system processes live video input, identifying objects and determining their distance to guide users effectively.
